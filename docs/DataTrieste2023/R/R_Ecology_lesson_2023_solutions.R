## Under Files tab -> click on New Project -> 
## New Directory -> New Project ->
## Type "my_project" as directory name -> Create Project

## Under Files tab -> click on New Folder -> create new folder called "data"
   # Alternatively, you can type dir.create("data")
   # Use this folder to store raw data
   # Always keep your raw data raw!
   # Separate processed data from raw data
   # Create another directory for data_output, fig_output and scripts

## Create new R script in your working directory -> click on symbol -> R Script -> my_script.R
  # Move the script to the scripts directory

## Your working directory should look like:

# CREATING OBJECTS --------------------------------------------------------

# Type the following in the CONSOLE:

## Get output from R by typing math in console
3 + 5
12 / 7

## Assign values to objects
   # Give it a name
   # Assignment operator <- (Alt + "-")
   # Value
weight_kg <- 55 
   # assigns value on right to object on left, i.e. 55 goes into weight_kg
   # no output is printed in console -> stored in memory (Environment)
   
   # To print the value, type the name of the object:
weight_kg
 
   # R is case-sensitive, i.e. x is different from X
   # don't use names of functions, such as c, mean, etc.
   # avoid dots -> many functions in R with dots in their names (special meaning)
   # names can't start with numbers
   # use a consistent style

# Convert weight from kg to pounds
2.2 * weight_kg

# Change a variable's value
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg

# Assigning a value to one variable does not change values of other variables
# Let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new variable
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
2.2 * weight_kg -> weight_lb # alternative

# Now change weight_kg to 100
weight_kg <- 100

# What will the value of weight_lb be? 126.5 or 220?
weight_lb

## Saving your code
# Up to now, your code has been in the console
# Not useful for reproducibility
# Save the script as my_script.R

## Comments (Ctrl + Shift + c)
   # Anything to the right of # symbol will be ignored by R
   # Useful to make notes/explanations in your scripts

# CHALLENGE 1 -------------------------------------------------------------

# 1.1. Run the following code and indicate what the values 
# are after each statement:

mass <- 47.5            
# mass = 47.5

age  <- 122
# age = 122

mass_index <- mass/age
# mass_index = 0.389

mass <- mass * 2.0
# mass = 95

mass_index
# mass_index = 0.389 #it didn't change - need to rerun line 92

# FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS -------------------------------------------

a <- 9 # assign value of 9 to the object a
b <- sqrt(a) 

# value of a is given to sqrt() function
# function calculates square root and returns the value
# which is then assigned to the variable b

b

# return value doesn't need to be numerical or a single item
# it can be a set of things, or even a dataset

# Each function's arguments are different
# If arguments are left out, default values are used, called "options"
# Options alter the way a function operates, e.g. ignore "bad values"


# Let's try a function that can take multiple arguments
round(3.14159)

# we called the round function with only one argument and it returned the value 3
# it was rounded to the nearest whole number
# if you want a different number of digits, look at the arguments or look at the help
args(round)
?round
# specify the number of digits you want
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
# if you provide arguments in the exact same order as they are defined, you don't have
# to name them
round(3.14159, 2)
# if you provide arguments in a different order than they are defined, you have to name them
round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)


# VECTORS AND DATA TYPES --------------------------------------------------

# Vector = most common and basic data type in R
# Contains series of values (numbers or characters)
# Use the concatenate function to assign series of values
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)  # create a vector of animal weights
weight_g

# A vector can also contain characters
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog") # quotes are essential
animals

# Inspect the content of a vector
length(weight_g) # tells you how many elements are in a particular vector
length(animals)

# All the elements are the same type of data
class(weight_g)
class(animals)

# To get an overview of the structure of an object and its elements
str(weight_g)
str(animals)

# Use the c() function to add elements to a vector
weight_g
weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector
weight_g <- c(weight_g[1:3], 63, weight_g[4:6]) # add to the middle of the vector
weight_g <- append(weight_g, 70, after = 5) # add to the middle of the vector


# CHALLENGE 2 -------------------------------------------------------------

# 2.1. What will happen in each of the following examples
# (hint: use class() to check data type or look at the environment)

num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
# class(num_char) # character

num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
# class(num_logical) # numeric

char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
# class(char_logical) # character

tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
# class(tricky) # character

# Answer: R converted the content of the vector to find a common denominator
# Converting objects from one class into another = coercion
# Conversions happen according to a hierarchy
# e.g. logical -> numeric -> character <- logical

# . -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# SUBSETTING VECTORS ------------------------------------------------------

# Extract one or several values
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
animals[c(3, 2)]
# R indices start at 1
# Other languages count from 0

# Repeat indices to create an object with more elements
more_animals <- animals[c(1,2,3,2,1,4)]
more_animals

## Conditional subsetting
# Use a logical vector to select the element with the same index
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]
# Get logicals with TRUE for indices that meet a specific condition
weight_g > 50
# So we can use this to select values above 50:
weight_g[weight_g > 50]
# Can combine multiple tests using & (both conditions true)
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g <= 35]
# or | (at least one condition is true)
weight_g[weight_g < 30 | weight_g > 50]

# Search for the vector in certain strings:
animals
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"]
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")]


# CHALLENGE 3 -------------------------------------------------------------

# 3.1. Can you figure out why "four" > "five" returns TRUE
# when you run the following code?

"four" > "five"

# When using ">" or "<" on strings, R compares their alphabetical order
# Here "four" comes after "five", and therefore the above statement returns "TRUE"

# . -----------------------------------------------------------------------


# Other types of vectors:
# logical = TRUE or FALSE
# integer = 2L
# complex = 1 + 4i (real and imaginary parts)
# raw = bitstreams

# Vectors are one of many data structures in R
# Other data structures:
# lists
# matrices
# data frames
# factors
# arrays

# . -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# . PRESENTATION
# . -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# MISSING DATA ------------------------------------------------------------

# Missing data are represented in vectors as NA
# Most functions will return NA if your data contains missing values

# To ignore missing values when doing calculations, use na.rm = TRUE
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
heights
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)

# Extract those elements which are NOT missing values
heights[!is.na(heights)]

# Remove incomplete cases
na.omit(heights)
# First line of output = all cases that are not NA
# Second line of output = positions of deleted values
# Third line of output = class of deleted values

# Extract those elements which are complete cases
heights[complete.cases(heights)]



# CHALLENGE 4 -------------------------------------------------------------

# 4.1. Use the following vector (heights in inches) and create a new vector
# (called "heights_no_na") with NAs removed.

heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)

heights_no_na <- heights[!is.na(heights)] 
# or
heights_no_na <- na.omit(heights)
# or
heights_no_na <- heights[complete.cases(heights)]


# 4.2. Calculate the median (using the median() function) of the new heights_no_na vector.

median(heights_no_na)


# 4.3. How many people in the set are taller than 67 inches?
# Hint: Use conditional subsetting and the length() function

heights_above_67 <- heights_no_na[heights_no_na > 67]
length(heights_above_67)

# . -----------------------------------------------------------------------


# LOADING AND INSPECTING DATA ---------------------------------------------

## Download the survey data to the data sub-directory
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data/portal_data_joined.csv")

# Load the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse) 
# If you get an error: could not find function "read_csv",
# load the tidyverse package again.

# (1) Load the data via command line
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv") # OR

# (2) Load the data via command line
surveys <- read_csv(file.choose()) #OR

# (3) Load the data using the interface
# In Environment window -> Import Dataset -> Browse for the file -> 
# Change the name to `surveys` and select Yes for headers before importing #OR

# (4) Load the data using the interface
# In Files window -> browse for file -> click on file ->
# Import Dataset -> same options as (3)

# No output, because assignments don't display anything

# Let's check that our data has been loaded
surveys

# Let's check the top 6 lines of this data frame
head(surveys)
head(surveys, n = 10)
View(surveys) # uppercase V

## We are studying the species and weight of animals caught in plots in our study area.
## Dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file.
## Each row = information for a single animal; each column = variable
## NB! Use the read_csv2 function if you are using different field separators
## Use the read_tsv() function for tab separated data files and
## read_delim() for less common formats.

### WHAT ARE DATA FRAMES? ###
## It's a data structure for most tabular data
## We use it for statistics and plotting
## It can be created by hand using functions or imported with read_csv() or read_table()
## Data is represented in the format of a table where columns = vectors 
## (all have the same length and each vector contains the same type of data)

## Look at the size of the data
dim(surveys) 
# dimensions: no. of rows; no. of columns

nrow(surveys) 
# no. of rows

ncol(surveys) 
# no. of clumns

## Look at the content
head(surveys)
# first 6 rows

tail(surveys)
# last 6 rows

## Look at the names
names(surveys)
# column names

rownames(surveys)
# row names

## Look at summary of data
str(surveys) 
# structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column

summary(surveys)
# summary statistics for each column


# CHALLENGE 5 -------------------------------------------------------------


# Based on output of str(surveys), answer the following:
str(surveys)

# 5.1. What is the data structure of the object surveys?  
# dataframe

# 5.2. How many rows and columns are in this object?  
# 34786 rows, 13 columns

# . -----------------------------------------------------------------------


# INDEXING AND SUBSETTING DATA FRAMES -------------------------------------

surveys[1, 1]  # 1st element in 1st column
surveys[1, 6]  # 1st element in 6th column
surveys[, 1]  # 1st column
surveys[1]  # 1st column
surveys[1:3, 7]  # 1st 3 elements in 7th column
surveys[3, ]  # 3rd element for all columns
head_Surveys <- surveys[1:6, ]  # same as head(surveys)
head_Surveys


# Exclude certain parts of a data frame
surveys[, -1]  # the whole data frame except 1st column
surveys[-(7:34786), ]  # same as head(surveys)

# Subset columns by names
surveys["species_id"]  # data.frame
surveys[, "species_id"]   # data.frame 
surveys[["species_id"]]   # vector  
surveys$species_id    # vector


# CHALLENGE 6 -------------------------------------------------------------

# 6.1. Create a `data.frame` (`surveys_200`) containing only the
#    200th observation of the `surveys` dataset.
surveys_200 <- surveys[200, ]  # extract observations from row 200

# 6.2. Notice how `nrow(surveys)` gave you the number of rows in a `data.frame`?
#    6.2.1. Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame (surveys).
n_rows <- nrow(surveys)  # get the number of rows in surveys dataset: 34786
surveys_last <- surveys[n_rows, ]  # get the last row by using previous answer

#    6.2.2. Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` 
#         to make sure it's meeting expectations.
tail(surveys, n = 1)  # compare this with previous result

# 6.3. Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame.
#    Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.
surveys_middle <- surveys[n_rows/2, ]

# 6.4. Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of
#   `head(surveys)` keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.
surveys[-(7:n_rows),]

# . -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# FACTORS -----------------------------------------------------------------

## When we did str(surveys), we saw several columns consisting of numeric data (col_double)
## Several columns contained character data (col_character) which should be categorical
## R has a special class for working with categorical data, called factor
## Factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as levels (by default sorted alphabetically)
## Factors are stored as integers and have labels (text) associated with these unique integers
## Factors can be ordered or unordered
## While factors look like character vectors, they are actually treated as integers

# . -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# . PRESENTATION . #
# . -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Let's create a factor with 3 levels
animal_sizes <- factor(c("M", "S", "S", "M", "L", "M"))  # c = concatenate
# R will assign 1 to the level 'L', 2 to 'M', and 3 to 'S'

# Check this level assignment
levels(animal_sizes)  # check the levels, i.e. L, M, S

# Check number of levels
nlevels(animal_sizes)  # check the number of levels, i.e. 3
animal_sizes  # [1] M S S M L M - before ordering - levels: L M S

# Sometimes the order of the factors does not matter, 
# other times you might want to specify the order (e.g. low, medium, high)
# Let's reorder the levels
animal_sizes <- factor(animal_sizes, levels = c("S", "M", "L"))
animal_sizes  # [1] M S S M L M - after ordering - levels: S M L
# In R's memory these factors are represented by integers (1,2,3)


## Converting factors

# Convert a factor to a character vector
as.character(animal_sizes)  

# To convert factors to numbers...
# 1st convert factors to characters, then to numbers
year_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990)) 
as.numeric(year_fct)  #wrong!!!
as.numeric(as.character(year_fct))  #works...
as.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct]  #recommended way
# 1. obtain all the factor levels using levels(year_fct)
# 2. convert levels to numeric values using as.numeric(levels(year_fct))
# 3. access numeric values using the integers of the vector year_fct

## Renaming factors

# When your data is stored as a factor, you can use the plot() function to get a quick glance at it.

# Let's convert the sex variable from character to factor
surveys$sex <- factor(surveys$sex)

# no. of observations represented by each factor level
plot(surveys$sex)  # bar plot of number of females and males (by default, NA values excluded)

# Let's pull out the data on sex 
sex_data <- surveys$sex
head(sex_data)  # view first few lines
levels(sex_data)  # view levels (missing data not shown as a level)

# Let's add the NA values
sex_data <- addNA(sex_data)
plot(sex_data) # No label for the missing data

levels(sex_data) 
levels(sex_data)[3] <- "undetermined"  # use indexing and replace NA with "undetermined"
levels(sex_data)
head(sex_data)
plot(sex_data)


# CHALLENGE 7 -------------------------------------------------------------

# 7.1. Rename "F" and "M" to "female" and "male", respectively

levels(sex_data)[1] <- "female"
levels(sex_data)[2] <- "male"

# OR rename both at the same time
levels(sex_data)[1:2] <- c("female", "male")

# 7.2. Check that the levels have been renamed
levels(sex_data)

plot(sex_data)

# 7.3. Recreate the bar plot such that "undetermined" is first (before "female")
sex_data_ordered <- factor(sex_data, levels = c("undetermined", "female", "male"))
plot(sex_data_ordered)

# . -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# CHALLENGE 8 -------------------------------------------------------------

# Instead of creating a data frame with read.csv(), you can create your own using data.frame()

# 8.1. The following code has a few mistakes. Try to fix it. 
# missing quotes in 'animals' column
# missing entry in 'feel' column
# missing one comma in 'weight' column

# Now fix the code:
animal_data <- data.frame(animal=c("dog", "cat", "sea cucumber", "sea urchin"),
                          feel=c("furry", "squishy", "spiny", "smooth"),
                          weight=c(45, 8, 1.1, 0.8))
animal_data


# 8.2. Can you predict the class for each of the columns in the following example?
     # Check your guesses using `str(country_climate)`:

country_climate <- data.frame(country=c("Canada", "Panama", "South Africa", "Australia"),
                              climate=c("cold", "hot", "temperate", "hot/temperate"),
                              temperature=c(10, 30, 18, "15"),
                              northern_hemisphere=c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, "FALSE"),
                              has_kangaroo=c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, 1))

str(country_climate)

#      8.2.1. Are they what you expected? Why? Why not?
#      No - almost all variables are characters

#      8.2.2. What would you need to change to ensure that each column had the
#        accurate data type?
#      Remove the quotes around numbers and logicals and make sure data type is the same for each vector.

# Be aware of the automatic conversion of data types!
# The coersion rule goes logical -> numeric -> character <-logical.

# 1. remove quotes in temperature and northern_hemisphere
# 2. replace 1 by TRUE in has_kangaroo column

# FORMATTING DATES --------------------------------------------------------

# One common issue: converting date and time information 
# into a variable that is appropriate and usable during analyses

# Store each component of your date separately, like the 'surveys' dataset

# RESHAPING WITH pivot_longer AND pivot_wider ----------------------------------------

# Remember the 4 rules of defining tidy data:
# 1. Each variable has its own column
# 2. Each observation has its own row
# 3. Each value must have its own cell
# 4. Each type of observational unit forms a table

# What if instead of comparing records, 
# we wanted to compare the different mean weight 
# of each genus between plots?

# This means the values of the genus column would 
# become the names of column variables and the cells 
# would contain the values of the mean weight observed on each plot.

# 12.1. Pivot the surveys data frame with `year` as columns,

#    You will need to summarize before reshaping, and

#    This makes it difficult to do things like look at the 
#    relationship between mean values of each measurement 
#    per year in different plot types. Let's walk through 
#    a common solution for this type of problem. 

#    First, use `pivot_longer()` to create a dataset where 
#    we have a column called `measurement` and a `value`

#    With this new dataset, calculate the average 
#    of each `measurement` in each `year` for each different 
#    `plot_type`. Then `pivot_wider` them into a data set with 
#    a column for `hindfoot_length` and `weight`.

## Assign the plot to a variable to create a plot template

# Scatter plots can be useful for small datasets

# whiskers go to further non-outlier points
# outliers = values > 1.5 * IQR (measured from edges of box)

       mapping = aes(x = genus, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = plot_id)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3)
# This doesn't work... because plot_id is currently an integer

# Check the class for 'plot_id'
class(surveys_complete$plot_id) # numeric

# Change the class from integer to factor and plot data again

       mapping = aes(x = genus, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = as.factor(plot_id))) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3)

# 14.5. Why does this change how R makes the graph?
# Answer: ggplot2 treats integer and numeric values as continuous, 
# and it treats factors and characters as discrete (categorical).

# Discrete variables = values that are clearly distinguishable and
# disconnected from each other; also called categorical variables
# Examples: plot_id, sex, species_id, genus, species, taxa, plot_type

# Continuous variables = values that are not clearly distinguishable
# i.e. for any two possible values of the variable, it is always
# possible to find another value that lies between them
# Examples: weight, hindfoot_length
# Note: a continuous variable can be categorised by using as.factor()
