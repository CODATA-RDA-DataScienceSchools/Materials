Notes: These sessions will be run in the Informatics Lab (across the foyer from our seminar room). Make sure you have your username and password to log into the computers in the lab. I recommend in the first instance using these rather than your own laptop, but we will help to install anything on your laptop to get things running after the school.
 
Shell ethics exercise: making CLI teaching more accessible 
In this exercise we discussed the dominance of the English language in CLI commands. We brainstormed some ideas for how to make CLI teaching more accessible to non-native English speakers and/or users with disabilities.

Introduction to git

An error was found by Ubaid Ahmad Dar on the material, on 'Tracking Changes'. Instead of saying `"git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)` it should say `git restore`. The issue has been reported already :) https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice/issues/691
 
GitHub ethics exercise: making informed decisions about using commercial Open Science tools
In this exercise we discussed how GitHub, as a commercial company registered in the US, was blocked to users from countries against which the US holds sanctions. Many of you said that you would use GitHub in the future, but also try to mirror your resources using a more open platform to ensure that there was access for users from restricted countries. There are a few alternatives to GitHub that you can check out.
Alternatives to GitHub - please note these are also commercial services like GitHub and hence you should check their terms and conditions (for example - GitHub uses all the text it has on GitHub to train its AI service GitHub CoPilot - this is a very nice tool but they are using what you submit to them in a way you didn't suspect). 
https://bitbucket.org/
https://gittea.dev/
 
GitLab https://about.gitlab.com/  is a different offering. They provide software for you to install on your servers (https://about.gitlab.com/install/) which runs GitLab there. Getting the software requires a system administrator but it means that you could have a service that is like GitHub but running within your institutions servers and hence one can control it accordingly.
 
There is also another package called gogs https://gogs.io/ which is still in very development (V0.3) and hence is likely o be very buggy. That said, this is deigned to act as a very light-weight git platform where the installation is less complicated than gitlab (though still not trivial).

Ethics exercise: joining the R community and contributing to forums
In this exercise we discussed the importance of user communities to the survival and strength of any Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). In contrast to commercial software, which is privately developed and maintained, FOSS are developed and maintained by user communities who volunteer time, software and expertise. Being part of these communities - through online forums etc - is an important part of being an open and responsible FOSS user. Even if you do not feel that you have the expertise yet to answer questions or contribute code, you can still be active in the community by registering for the forum, making connections with other users, and potentially organizing local events around R. 
R has a good guidance document that might help you think through organzing local events: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Community_Building_Resources 
And I would point out this guideline document for Code CAFEs: https://code-cafes-nl.github.io/cafe_playbook/

#1. As we did for lifeExp plot the distributions separately for each continent
ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=gdpPercap, fill=continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.3)
 
#2.  plot GDP on a log scale
ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=log(gdpPercap), fill=continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.3)
 
#3. Make boxplots of gdpPercap by continent
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap ,fill = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplots of GDP per Capita by Continent",
       x = "Continent",
       y = "GDP per Capita") 
 
#4. Do the same, but plot GDP on a log scale
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = log10(gdpPercap) ,fill = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplots of GDP per Capita by Continent",
       x = "Continent",
       y = "GDP per Capita")

 #1. Make a plot of lifeExp vs gdpPercap for China and India, with both lines and points
china_india_data <- subset(gapminder, country %in% c("China", "India"))
# Create a plot of lifeExp vs gdpPercap for China and India
ggplot(china_india_data, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +

       x = "GDP per Capita",
       y = "Life Expectancy",
       color = "Country")
  scale_x_log10()   # Log scale on x-axis
#How has life expectancy changed over time? 
#by plotting a line for each country over year

       #use the dplyr "pipe" notation (%>%) to send the gapminder data to the dplyr:;mutate() function, and within that,
