### Test Activity

Please complete these activities on the same computer you are going to
use on Thursday. Let me know if there’s something that is not working
before then.

1.  Open RStudio.
2.  Click **File** \> **New File** \> **Quarto Document**.
3.  Type a title for your Quarto document and click **Create**.
4.  Click the **Render** button and name the file as `report.qmd`.

A `report.html` document will be generated in your working directory that includes both content and the output
of embedded code. 

If it doesn’t work, please let us know!
