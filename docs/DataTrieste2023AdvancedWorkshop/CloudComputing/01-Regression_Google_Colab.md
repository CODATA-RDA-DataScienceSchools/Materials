# Apache Spark on Google Colab

Google Colaboratory (Colab) allows you to execute code on Google's cloud servers, meaning you can leverage the power of Google hardware, including GPUs and TPUs, regardless of the power of your machine. 

We are going to use this free cloud resource to run a regression analysis on a common open data set that describes housing data in the Boston, US area. 

## Log Onto Google Colab

   * Point your browser at the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) site.
   * If you are not signed in, use the _Sign In_ button on the top right of the screen. 
   * You will be presented with a popup box that allows importing a file or starting a new file. Hit the _Cancel_ button and take some time to read the _"What is Colaboratory?"_ document. 
   * Once you have a general understanding of what Colab is, proceed to the next section.

## Import Code from GitHub

   * Upload a file from the _File_ menu using the _Upload Notebook_ option. 
   * You will see a popup that looks like this:
   <img src="Colab_Open.png" width="800"/><br>
   * Click the _GitHub_ link on the top bar menu.
   * Enter this link: https://github.com/CODATA-RDA-DataScienceSchools/Materials/blob/master/docs/SouthAfrica2021/Colab_Regression_Spark.ipynb into the search field.
   * This will open the Apache Spark based Regression Analysis Notebook we will be looking at during this lesson.

## Run Regression Analysis with Apache Spark
   * Each step is explained in the document - run each code section in order. 
   * **NOTE:** You must do the steps in order as software packages will be installed on the cloud resource and later steps will not work if you do not complete the earlier steps. 
   * Read through the explanation of each step.
   * Keep in mind you will be importing your own data set (or pick an example data set) in hands-on exercise 4 on your own International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) OpenStack cloud resource, which you will create yourself. So while you can go through this lesson quickly, take time to understand what is happening in each step.
