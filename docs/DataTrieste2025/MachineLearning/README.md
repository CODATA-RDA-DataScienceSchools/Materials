## Introduction to Machine Learning and Recommender Systems (2025)

Welcome to the repository for the **Introduction to Machine Learning and Recommender Systems** lecture at the **CODATA-RDA School of Research Data Science (SoRDS)**. This repository contains materials related to the 2025 edition of the course, which covers foundational topics in machine learning, recommender systems, and the rise of generative AI.

## Contents

### 1. **Lecture Materials (PDFs)**
- **[Module - Introduction to Machine Learning 2025.pdf](./1.%20Module%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%202025.pdf)**  
  This module introduces key concepts in machine learning, covering supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, model evaluation, and real-world applications.
  
- **[Module - Recommender Systems 2025.pdf](./2.%20Module%20-%20Recommender%20Systems%202025.pdf)**  
  This module focuses on the theory and practice of recommender systems, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.

- **[Module - The Rise of Generative AI 2025.pdf](./3.%20Module%20-%20The%20Rise%20of%20Generative%20AI%202025.pdf)**  
  This module explores the latest advancements in generative AI, including natural language processing and generative models such as GANs and transformers.


### 2. **Hands-on Notebooks**
The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for hands-on exercises, allowing students to apply the concepts learned in the modules.

- **[ICTP_Regression_2025.ipynb](./notebooks/ICTP_Regression_2025.ipynb)**  
  This notebook provides hands-on experience with regression models, covering linear regression, model evaluation, and feature selection.

- **[ICTP_Recommender_2025.ipynb](./notebooks/ICTP_Recommender_2025.ipynb)**  
  This notebook guides you through building a basic recommender system, implementing collaborative filtering and evaluating its performance.

### 3. **Data**
The `data/` directory contains all the datasets required for the hands-on exercises.

- **[Data Folder](./data/)**  
  This folder includes datasets used in the hands-on notebooks for the recommender system and regression exercises.

## How to Use

### Running the Notebooks on Google Colab:
1. Open the notebook file on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click on "File" > "Open notebook" > "GitHub".
3. Paste the URL of this repository (or the specific notebook) into the provided field.
4. Google Colab will automatically load the notebook, and you can start running the code without needing to set up any local environment.

   **Note:** For datasets, you can either upload them manually in Google Colab or modify the code to access them via Google Drive. Refer to the `data/` folder and adapt paths as needed.

### **ALTERNATIVE:** Running the Notebooks Locally:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
3. Open the notebooks using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ICTP_Recommender_2025.ipynb
   jupyter notebook ICTP_Regression_2025.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in each notebook to complete the hands-on exercises.
