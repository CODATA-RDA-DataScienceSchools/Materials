## Introduction

-   [About Marcela](https://malfaro.netlify.app/)
-   [About Bianca](https://binxiepeterson.github.io/)
-   [About Hugh](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1374-6015)
-   [About this curriculum](https://authorcarpentry.github.io/)

## First

-   Find your ORCiD link and prepare to post it on the etherpad, next to your name.
-   Questions to discuss in pairs and/or in the chat:
    -   Have you used ORCiD to link your publications?
    -   Do you think it's important to have and use one?

## What are we going to do this afternoon?

1.  Discuss workflows for academic publishing.
2.  Learn how to use Quarto for reproducible reports - how to include bibliography from .bib files, and how to cite data and/or software, and more.
3.  Discuss authorship, and contributorship in collaborative research projects.

## Workflows

-   Discuss in pairs and/or in the chat: [what's your workflow?](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/workflows/)
-   If you could describe your workflow for Discovery - Analysis - Writing - Publication - Outreach - Assessment, what would it look like?
-   Describe it in the etherpad.

‚è∞ 10 minutes

## Reproducibility from a qualitative perspective

- Good understanding of reproducibility from a quantitative perspective.

- Less well defined from a qualitative perspective. 

- Good paper from [FORTT](https://forrt.org/curated_resources/reproducibility-and-replicability-of-qua/)


## Why do we want to work on repro-mode?

[![The Turing Way: Advantages of Reproducible Research](https://book.the-turing-way.org/build/reasons-reproducibil-50c3447f47cfdb55ed075f8f8e4202de.png){fig-align="center" width=60%}](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-benefit.html)

## What is Quarto? (1/3)

-   Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc (same as LateX).
-   Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable (JavaScript).
-   Author documents using Jupyter notebooks or with plain text markdown using your favorite editor (e.g. VS Code, RStudio, Jupyter Lab, etc.).

## What is Quarto? (2/3)

-   Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
-   Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, figure panels, advanced layout, and more.

## What is Quarto? (3/3)

Some examples:

-   This presentation was done in Quarto. üòÉ

-   You can produce HTML reports such as [this one](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-gallery/page-layout/tufte.html).

-   Other examples: <https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/>

    üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è If you want to look at the code for these examples, click on the `</>` icon.

## What tools did we use before Quarto?

-   Word processor (Microsoft Word, Open Office, Google Docs, etc.)
-   Jupyter Notebooks
-   R Markdown
-   LaTeX (Overleaf, TeXstudio, etc.)
-   Any other? Type it in the chat (online) or say it out loud (in class).

## What changed?

[![The Turing Way: Guide for Reproducible Research](https://book.the-turing-way.org/build/reproducibility-a799e60c55c02ae40338ff00c23b3d38.jpg){fig-align="center" width=60%}](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research.html)

## Anatomy of a Quarto document

-   **`YAML`**: "YAML is a human-readable data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files. It contains the metadata (title, tags, and descriptions) for the document.
-   **`Main Body`**: Text, which may include in-line code, written in [markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) (plain text formatting) syntax.
-   **`Code Chunks`**: Code in different languages (depending on what you have installed on your computer) that can be executed when the document is rendered.

## Let's do it!

Follow these steps:

1.  Open RStudio.
2.  Click **`File`** \> **`New Project`** \> **`New Directory`** \> **`Quarto Project`** \> Name your Directory and click on **`Create git repository`** \> **`Create Project`**.
3.  Click on **`Render`** to test that the most basic Quarto document renders on your computer.
4.  If it worked, you should see a `<filename>.html` file in your local folder. Open it in your Web Browser.

## Let's start with YAML

-   Be careful with the indentation!

-   Let's add: title, author, and date.

‚è∞ 2 minutes

```         
---
title: "Reproducible Report Example"
author: Your name
date: 2023/08/03
format: gfm 
---
```

## YAML details

It depends on the format you want to work in:

-   [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/gfm.html)
-   [HTML](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html)
-   [PDF](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html)
-   [MS Word](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html)
-   Other formats (Presentations, Open Office, ePub, etc.)

## We will continue to work in HTML

-   Why? Because it's more flexible.
-   Nevertheless, you can also use `gfm` format to create `Readme.md` files for your repo on GitHub or GitLab.
-   It is possible to deploy as a webpage on GitHub/GitLab.
-   Data and code are available from your repo as a [Webpage](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
-   You can also [add a DOI](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content).

## Now let's add text in the Main Body

```         
## Introduction

This is a Quarto document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

Another way to create links is to use: [a label with a link](https://quarto.org)
```

ü§ì Go through [this tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) to learn markdown in a fun, interactive way!

## And now, the code chunks:

Here we call the Python \`mean()\` function

The function's output is included immediately below the code.

:::: {.rows}
::: {.row height="50%"}
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
import pandas as pd
my_data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepak525/Investigate_TMDb_Movies/master/tmdb-movies.csv")
my_data['budget'].mean()
```
:::
::::

How much do you want to see?

#| echo: true

#| code-fold: true


## Plot Output

(Will discuss plots more next week)

```{python}
#| label: Plot

import pandas as pd
from plotnine import (
    ggplot,
    aes,
    geom_point
)
df = pd.DataFrame({"x" : [1,2,3,4], "y" : [ 10, 20, 30, 40]})
(
    ggplot(df, aes("x", "y"))
    + geom_point()
)
```

## Tables {.smaller}

Use the pandas  function to print tables as HTML:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepak525/Investigate_TMDb_Movies/master/tmdb-movies.csv")
data.head()
```

## LaTeX Math

You can also include LaTeX math:


\$\$
  P\\left(A=2\\middle\|\\frac{A\^2}{B}\>4\\right)
\$\$

$$
P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}>4\right)
$$


## Add bibliography

This is the list of articles we'll use:

0.  They can be found in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14QsEDkAoyEt4eeobQFJi6o-reHYC03Nx?usp=sharing)
1.  @Doney2009
2.  @Jullion2014
3.  @Menezes2017
4.  @Resplandy2018
5.  @Hahn2017

## .bib files

The easiest way to do this is maintaining a `.bib` file. You can create it using Zotero, or you can create it manually using <https://www.doi2bib.org/>.

-   Zotero: Select the library you wish to export to BibTex in Zotero.
-   Create a file in any Text editor -\> paste the bibs using <https://www.doi2bib.org/> and save it as `<filename>.bib` in the same project folder.


## Citing software and data

-   From IEEE: <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9018356>
-   From PeerJ: <https://peerj.com/articles/cs-86/>
-   Persistent identifiers for code and data. How? Zenodo, FigShare, Institutional Repository, GitHub/DOI.

## Now, let's go back to the author process


[![The Turing Way: Collaboration](https://book.the-turing-way.org/build/collaboration-805fc07aa6ed2207d47d0e3241a1e54f.svg){fig-align="center" width=60%}](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/collaboration.html)

## Group Discussion (1/2)

You are about to start an interdisciplinary project with 5 collaborators. They are from different areas of expertise, a couple of them are from different countries. You want to keep working with a reproducible workflow, but you know most of them are not proficient in some of the tools you use.



## Group Discussion (2/2)
Q1. How/when do you negotiate which tools you are going to use to work on the project? Which factors do you need to take into account when deciding which tools to use?

--

Q2. When and how would you discuss the author contributions in the paper? You can use this as a guide: <https://credit.niso.org/>

--

Q3. How/when should you decide which journals do you want to publish in?
