# OpenStack Regression Analysis


   * **NOTE:** This is an exact replication of Exercise 1. To get the most out of this exercise, find a dataset that is important to your research. Try searching Kaggle.com if you want to find an interesting data set in your discipline.

## Import the Notebook

   * The OpenStack recreation of the Google Colab regression analysis is available at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CODATA-RDA-DataScienceSchools/Materials/master/docs/SouthAfrica2021/OpenStack_Regression.ipynb
   * Download this file to your local machine and save it. 
   * Use the _Upload_ button in your notebook to upload the analysis code. 
   * After uploading, the file will appear in your notebook. Click on the file to open it. 

## Replace the Dataset
   * **NOTE:** There are minimal notes in this recreated Regression analysis, only where the commands are changed to port from Google Colab. If you want to review the detailed notes,see your notebook in Colab. 
   * Run the code in order for the first 4 code boxes. 
   * In code box 5 you will change the data set to do a different analysis. Pick something important to you. 
   * The World Bank's economic, education and environment, health and poverty, private sector, and public sector development indicators are avaialble at https://www.kaggle.com/docstein/brics-world-bank-indicators. Can you find any interesting information from one of these datasets? 
   * It's not the same regression analysis, but take a look at these visualizations created with these datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/xiaokangqin/brics-development-indicators-data-visualization. Can you get this notebook to work? **Hint:** You may need to import some additional libraries. 

## Conclusion
   * We've talked about how to think about your needs for cyberinfrastructure. As your research gains complexity, so will your computing needs. You will often start on your own laptop, but find that you need more computing power and need to leverage Institutional Clusters, High Throughput Computing, High Performance Computing, Cloud Computing, or even more likely some combination of several of these.  We've introduced you to several options and shown you with hands-on exercises how to do some simple analysis tasks in cloud environments. 
   * Good luck and happy computing!!
