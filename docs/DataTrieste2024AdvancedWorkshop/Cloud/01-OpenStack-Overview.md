# Overview of the Hands-on Cyberinfrastructure Exercises

## Exercise 1 - Setting Up A Cloud Resource Using OpenStack

[Exercise 1](02-Create_a_VM.md) will walk you through creating a Virtual
Machine (VM) using the OpenStack browser based API. Upon completion you will
have created and securely connected to a cloud resource hosted by the
ICTP. 

After creating the machine, the next exercise, the [Exercise
2](02-Connect_And_Install.md) - Connect to Your OpenStack VM and prepare it for
installing a Jupyter Notebook.

## Exercise 3 - Creating A Cloud Based Jupyter Notebook

In [Exercise 3](03-install-conda-and-jupyter.md) - Deploying a *Jupyter
Notebook Server* at an *IaaS* platform using the *conda* environment manager
you will use the VM you created in Exercise 2 to set up an online Jupyter
Notebook. This notebook will be used in the next exercise to recreate the
regression analysis from Exercise 1, this time with a new data set of your
choosing. 

## Exercise 4 - Regression Analysis Using Jupyter

We can start with a Python and data analysis refresher by revisiting the Boston Housing dataset analysis on [Google Colab](06-warmup-google-colab.md)

We return to the Spark data Analysis task to recreate a new regression
analysis on the VM you've created to do your own work in [Exercise
4](04-OpenStack_Regression_Analysis.md)
