## Introduction 

-   [About Marcela](https://malfaro.netlify.app/)
-   [About Bianca](https://binxiepeterson.github.io/)
-   [About this curriculum](https://authorcarpentry.github.io/)

## First things first

-   Create your ORCiD account: [https://orcid.org/register](https://orcid.org/register) 
There are two videos that 
a) explain why ORCIDs are a good idea - that can be found here https://vimeo.com/97150912
b) how to register on ORCID - that can be found here https://vimeo.com/236778203 
Many other videos on ORCID can be found here https://info.orcid.org/video-tutorials/

⏰ 15 minutes

## First things first

-   Find your ORCiD link and prepare to post it on the etherpad, next to your name on the Etherpad [https://pad.carpentries.org/Heredia2024](https://pad.carpentries.org/Heredia2024).
-   Questions to discuss in pairs:
    -   Have you used ORCiD to link your publications?
    -   Do you think it's important to have and use one?
    
⏰ 5 minutes

## What are we going to do this afternoon?

1.  Discuss workflows for academic publishing.
2.  Learn how our curriculum is linked to those workflows.
3.  Discuss authorship, and contributorship in collaborative research projects.
4. Present resources to identify predatory journals.

## Workflows

-   Discuss in pairs: [what's your workflow?](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/workflows/)
-   If you could describe your workflow for Discovery - Analysis - Writing - Publication - Outreach - Assessment, what would it look like?
-   Describe it on paper and prepare to share it with the rest of the group.

⏰ 10 minutes


## Now, let's go back to the author process

## Group Discussion (1/2)

You are about to start an interdisciplinary project with 5 collaborators. They are from different areas of expertise, a couple of them are from different countries. You want to keep working with a reproducible workflow, but you know most of them are not proficient in some of the tools you use.

--

Q1. How/when do you negotiate which tools you are going to use to work on the project? Which factors do you need to take into account when deciding which tools to use?

## Group Discussion (2/2)

Q2. When and how would you discuss the author contributions in the paper? You can use this as a guide: <https://credit.niso.org/>

--

Q3. How/when should you decide which journals do you want to publish in?

⏰ 15 minutes

## Where do we publish it? 

-   Please check out the materials from Andy Nobes on how to avoid predatory journals:

    -   "How to avoid 'predatory' journals" - [Andy Nobes](https://www.inasp.info/staff/andy-nobes-0)
    - [https://bit.ly/4hw9DCt](https://bit.ly/4hw9DCt)
    
-   Work on the exercise on slide 42 in pairs.

⏰ 20 minutes
