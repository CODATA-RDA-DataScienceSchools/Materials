## Introduction

-   [About Marcela](https://malfaro.netlify.app/)
-   [About Bianca](https://binxiepeterson.github.io/)
-   [About this curriculum](https://authorcarpentry.github.io/)

## First

-   Find your ORCiD link and prepare to post it on the etherpad, next to your name.
-   Questions to discuss in pairs and/or in the chat:
    -   Have you used ORCiD to link your publications?
    -   Do you think it's important to have and use one?

## What are we going to do this afternoon?

1.  Discuss workflows for academic publishing.
2.  Learn how to use Quarto for reproducible reports - how to include bibliography from .bib files, and how to cite data and/or software, and more.
3.  Discuss authorship, and contributorship in collaborative research projects.

## Workflows

-   Discuss in pairs and/or in the chat: [what's your workflow?](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/workflows/)
-   If you could describe your workflow for Discovery - Analysis - Writing - Publication - Outreach - Assessment, what would it look like?
-   Describe it in the etherpad.

⏰ 10 minutes


## Now, let's go back to the author process

## Group Discussion (1/2)

You are about to start an interdisciplinary project with 5 collaborators. They are from different areas of expertise, a couple of them are from different countries. You want to keep working with a reproducible workflow, but you know most of them are not proficient in some of the tools you use.

--

Q1. How/when do you negotiate which tools you are going to use to work on the project? Which factors do you need to take into account when deciding which tools to use?

## Group Discussion (2/2)

Q2. When and how would you discuss the author contributions in the paper? You can use this as a guide: <https://credit.niso.org/>

--

Q3. How/when should you decide which journals do you want to publish in?

## Where do we publish it? More about workflows!

-   We'll have the following guest talk:

    -   "How to avoid 'predatory' journals" - [Andy Nobes](https://www.inasp.info/staff/andy-nobes-0)
