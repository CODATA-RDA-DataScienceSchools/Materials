# Overview of the Hands-on Cyberinfrastructure Exercises

## Exercise 1 - Warmup and Regression Analysis Using Google Colab

In this exercise you will connect to Google Colab cloud resources.
The first task is just an *warmup*. A continuation of the work showed in the
tutorial for Google Colab. The steps and code need to complete this task can be
found at [Exercise 0](01-warmup-google-colab.md).

After completing the warmup you can move on the our first real exercise, at
which you will be asked to install Apache Spark, and run a regression analysis
on a dataset consisting of housing statistics in the Boston, US.

All steps and code necessary to complete this analysis can be found at
[Exercise 1](01-Regression_Google_Colab.md).

## Exercise 2 - Setting Up A Cloud Resource Using OpenStack

[Exercise 2](02-Create_A_VM.md) will walk you through creating a Virtual
Machine (VM) using the OpenStack browser based API. Upon completion you will
have created and securely connected to a cloud resource hosted by the
International Center of Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy. 

## Exercise 3 - Creating A Cloud Based Jupyter Notebook

In [Exercise 3](05-install-conda-and-jupyter.md) - Deploying a *Jupyter
Notebook Server* at an *IaaS* platform using the *conda* environment manager
you will use the VM you created in Exercise 2 to set up an online Jupyter
Notebook. This notebook will be used in the next exercise to recreate the
regression analysis from Exercise 1, this time with a new data set of your
choosing. 

## Exercise 4 - Regression Analysis Using Jupyter

We return to the method used in Exercise 1 to recreate a new regression
analysis on the VM you've created to do your own work in [Exercise
4](04-OpenStack_Regression_Analysis.md)
