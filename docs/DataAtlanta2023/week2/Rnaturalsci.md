Week Three - September 25-29 - The R Language for Statistical Computing - R for Natural Sciences

R lectures have two tracks: Natural Sciences or Social Sciences. Please choose and complete only ONE track. The contents are very similar in terms of R concepts, but differ in the application. This is the Natural Sciences Track. You can find the presentations [here](https://github.com/CODATA-RDA-DataScienceSchools/Materials/tree/master/docs/DataAtlanta2023/week2)
