# Overview

The [South Big Data Hub](https://southbigdatahub.org/) in collaboration with the [CODATA-RDA Schools of Research Data Science](https://www.datascienceschools.org/), and [AIM-AHEAD Southeast Hub at Morehouse School of Medicine](https://aim-ahead.net/) is hosting an 8-week Researcher Data Science Training through a mix of virtual and in-person instruction. This will be the first CODATA-RDA School run in the United States and will include teams from universities with the AIM-AHEAD Southeast Hub. The SMART-DART: Health Equity Cohort will focus on growing the competence of Health Equity researchers in accessing, analyzing, visualizing, and publishing data. It is open to participants from minority-serving institutions (MSIs), described in eligibility below. This activity will cover topics on principles and practice of Open Science, research data management and curation, use of a range of research compute infrastructures, large-scale analysis, statistics, visualization and modeling techniques, automation, and scripting.
