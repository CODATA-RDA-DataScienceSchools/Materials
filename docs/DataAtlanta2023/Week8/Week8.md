   * There are no required Hands-On lessons this week. 
      * However, if you'd like to play around with a Python Notebook that analyzes the Boston housing market by comparing multiple regression techniques, I've retested the hands-on lesson [here](https://github.com/CODATA-RDA-DataScienceSchools/Materials/blob/master/docs/SouthAfrica2021/Colab_Regression_Spark.ipynb) and it is a good example of using a clound-based CI.
      * If you don't have access to a Python Notebook Environment, [try this one](https://notebook.ospool.osg-htc.org) provided by the OSG. You can login with your institutional credential or even a Google account.
