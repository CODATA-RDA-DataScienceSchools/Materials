  Clustered          A computer cluster is a set of loosely or tightly
  Computing          connected computers that work together so that, in
                     many respects, they can be viewed as a single
                     system. In most cases computers that are clustered
                     are all within the same organization domain.

  High Performance   High Performance Computing most generally refers to
  Computing (HPC)    the practice of aggregating computing power in a way
                     that delivers much higher performance than one could
                     get out of a typical desktop computer or workstation
                     in order to solve large problems in science,
                     engineering, or business. HPC is synonymous with
                     parallel computing methods.

  High Throughput    High-throughput computing describes the use of many
  Computing (HTC)    computing resources over long periods of time to
                     accomplish a computational task.

  Cloud Computing    Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of
                     computer system resources, especially data storage
                     and computing power, without direct active
                     management by the user. Most cloud resources are
                     provisioned in the form of Virtual Machines (or
                     hardware-level virtualization).

  Containers         Containers or OS-level virtualization refers to an
                     operating system paradigm in which the kernel allows
                     the existence of multiple isolated user-space
                     instances.

  HTCondor, Slurm,   Examples of batch computing software. These allow
  PBS, SGE, LSF      headless (non-interactive) workflows to be managed.

  Virtual Machines   Provide hardware-level virtualization which emulate
                     a computer system through the use of software.

  Over training       Training a network on a sample so intensely that it
                      recognises features of specific individual events,
                      giving a misleading indication of its performance
                      on general samples.

  Training sample     Sample used for training

  Testing sample      Sample not used for training, but to measure
                      progress. \`Avoids being misled by over training

  ROC plot            "Receiver Operating Characteristic". A meaningless
                      acronym. Actually a 2D plot of the probability of

  GAN                 Global Adversarial Networks. Used to generate
                      apparently real data. See lecture 2 slide 9

  Deep learning       Means whatever you want it to mean. I take it as
                      neutral networks with many (\>5) layers.

  Kohonen Network     An unsupervised learning network. See lecture 2
                      slides 10-17

                      calls a Kohonen network.

  AI                           Artificial Intelligence - A branch of computer
                               science
  ---------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  ML                           Machine Learning - one of several AI techniques

  Supervised Learning          A method in ML where we already know the answers we
                               want

  Unsupervised Learning        We want to find unknown structures, patterns or
                               trends within a data set

  Item                         The entities a system recommends

  Attribute                    The characteristics of an item

  Query                        The information a system uses to make
                               recommendations

  Embedding                    A mapping from a discrete set (in this case, the set
                               of queries, or the set of items to recommend) to a
                               vector space called the embedding space. Many
                               recommendation systems rely on learning an
                               appropriate embedding representation of the queries
                               and items.

  Recommender/Recommendation   A subclass of information filtering system that seek
  Systems                      to predict the 'rating' or 'preference' that user
                               would give to an item

  Information Filtering        Delivery of information that the use us likely to
                               find interesting or useful

  Content-based Filtering      A content-based filtering system selects items based
                               on the correlation between the content of the items
                               and the user's preferences

  Collaborative Filtering      A collaborative filtering system chooses items based
                               on the correlation between people with similar
                               preferences.

  Measure of Effectiveness     The effectiveness of a recommender system is usually
                               determined by the ratios precision and recall.

  Precision                    Precision indicates how well the retrieved
                               information match a user's interest

  Recall                       Recall is the ratio of number of relevant documents
                               retrieved to the total number of relevant documents
                               in the collection

  Vectors                      An efficient way to represent data as an array
                               stored in memory as the models used for recommender
                               systems are fundamentally mathematical in nature.

  TF-IDF                       TF- IDF stands for Term Frequency and Inverse
                               Document Frequency .TF-IDF helps in evaluating
                               importance of a word in a document.

  Cosine Similarity            Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between
                               two non-zero vectors.
