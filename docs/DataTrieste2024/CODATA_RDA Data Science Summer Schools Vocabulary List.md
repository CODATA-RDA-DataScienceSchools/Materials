<th>Data steward</th>
<th>Data stewardship is a shared responsibility between Principal
Investigators and data stewards. Principal Investigators are responsible
for, and data stewards provide support for: (a) Data collection, data
integration, or reuse of existing data; (b) Review of data quality; (c)
Description of scientific workflow/process; (d) Provision of
standards-compliant metadata; and, (e) Submission of data and data
productions. Data stewards are responsible for, and Principle
Investigators are consulted and informed on: (a) Preservation of data
and data products; and, (b) Provision of formats (e.g., web services,
NetCDF, etc.) for data discovery and integration. In addition, Principal
Investigators are also responsible for data citation, as appropriate,
when preparing documentation, reports, or references. <a

<th>Research data</th>
<th>Data that are used as primary sources to support technical or
scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or artistic activity, and
that are used as evidence in the research process and/or are commonly
accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research
findings and results. All other digital and non-digital content have the
potential of becoming research data. Research data may be experimental
data, observational data, operational data, third party data, public
sector data, monitoring data, processed data, or repurposed data. <a

<th>Curation</th>
<th>The activity of managing and promoting the use of data from their
point of creation to ensure that they are fit for contemporary purpose
and available for discovery and reuse. For dynamic datasets this may
mean continuous enrichment or updating to keep them fit for purpose.
Higher levels of curation will also involve links with annotation and
with other published materials.<a

<tr>
<th>Digital preservation</th>
<th>The series of managed activities necessary to ensure continued
access to digital materials for as long as necessary. Digital
preservation is defined very broadly and refers to all of the actions
required to maintain access to digital materials beyond the limits of
media failure or technological change. Those materials may be records
created during the day-to-day business of an organisation;
""born-digital"" materials created for a specific purpose (e.g. teaching
resources); or the products of digitisation projects. This definition
specifically excludes the potential use of digital technology to
preserve the original artefacts through digitisation. RELATED TERM.

<tr>
<th>Research data management (RDM)</th>
<th>Data Management refers to the storage, access and preservation of
data produced from a given investigation. Data management practices
cover the entire lifecycle of the data, from planning the investigation
to conducting it, and from backing up data as it is created and used to
long term preservation of data deliverables after the research
investigation has concluded. Specific activities and issues that fall
within the category of data management include: File naming (the proper
way to name computer files); data quality control and quality assurance;
data access; data documentation (including levels of uncertainty);
metadata creation and controlled vocabularies; data storage; data
archiving and preservation; data sharing and reuse; data integrity; data
security; data privacy; data rights; notebook protocols (lab or field).

characteristics of other data, used to improve both business and
technical understanding of data and data-related processes. Business
metadata includes the names and business definitions of subject areas,
entities and attributes, attribute data types and other attribute
properties, range descriptions, valid domain values and their
definitions. Technical metadata includes physical database table and
column names, column properties, and the properties of other database
objects, including how data is stored. Process metadata is data that
defines and describes the characteristics of other system elements
(processes, business rules, programs, jobs, tools, etc.). Data
stewardship metadata is data about data stewards, stewardship processes
and responsibility assignments. <a

<th>Color blindness</th>
<th>Color blindness, also known as color vision deficiency, is the
decreased ability to see color or differences in color.
<mark>Colorblindness is not a total loss of color vision. Colorblind
people can recognize a wide range of colors. But certain ranges of
colors are hard to distinguish.</mark> Red-green color blindness is the
most common form, followed by blue-yellow color blindness and total
color blindness.Red-green color blindness affects up to 8% of males and
0.5% of females of Northern European descent. The ability to see color
also decreases in old age.</th>

<p>Good graphic design avoids using color coding or using color
contrasts alone to express information; this not only helps color blind
people, but also aids understanding by normally sighted people by
providing them with multiple reinforcing cues.</p></th>

<th>Misleading graph</th>
<th><p>Misleading graphs are sometimes deliberately misleading and
sometimes it’s just a case of people not understanding the data behind
the graph they create. The “classic” types of misleading graphs include
cases where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Vertical scale is too big or too small, or skips numbers, or
doesn’t start at zero.</p></li>
<li><p>The graph isn’t labeled properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Data is left out.</p></li>

<th>Data (variable) type</th>
<th>There are two types of variables—Quantitative(numericals) and
Qualitative(categoricals).</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Qualitative (categorical) variable</th>
<th><p>Descriptions of groups or things, like “breeds of dog” or “voting
preference”. The categorical variable can be divided into ordinals and
nominals (non-ordinals).</p>
<p>The ordinal variable can be ordered. For example, spiciness can be
mild, medium, or hot. Even if they are not numbers per se, they can
still be ordered. While nominals can’t be ordered. Two simple examples
are sex, male or female, or regions of the states Northeast, South,
Central, West.</p></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Quantitative(numerical) variable</th>
<th><p>Quantitative variables are numerical variables: counts, percents,
or numbers.</p>
<p>We can further divide numerical data into continuous and discrete.
Continuous variables are those that can take any value such as heights
if measured with enough precision. For example, a pair of twins maybe
68.12 inches and 68.11 inches respectively.</p>
<p>Counts such as population sizes are discrete because they have to be
round numbers.</p></th>

<u>Module: Computational Infrastructures</u>

| Term | Definition |

| Over training | Training a network on a sample so intensely that it recognises features of specific individual events, giving a misleading indication of its performance on general samples. |
| Training sample | Sample used for training |
| Testing sample | Sample not used for training, but to measure progress. \`Avoids being misled by over training |
| Validation | Establishing how well the network performs |
| ROC plot | “Receiver Operating Characteristic”. A meaningless acronym. Actually a 2D plot of the probability of accepting signal and backgRound events, for the range of cut values. |
| Regression | Using one (or more) variables to predict the value of another |
| PCA | Principal Component Analysis. Transforming a set of variables by a generalised rotation so that they are uncorrelated. |

| Recommender/Recommendation Systems | A subclass of information filtering system that seek to predict the ‘rating’ or ‘preference’ that user would give to an item |
| Information Filtering | Delivery of information that the use us likely to find interesting or useful |
| Content-based Filtering | A content-based filtering system selects items based on the correlation between the content of the items and the user’s preferences |
| Collaborative Filtering | A collaborative filtering system chooses items based on the correlation between people with similar preferences. |
| Measure of Effectiveness | The effectiveness of a recommender system is usually determined by the ratios precision and recall. |
| Precision | Precision indicates how well the retrieved information match a user’s interest |
