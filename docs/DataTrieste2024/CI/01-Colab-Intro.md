# Google Colab Warmup

Google Colaboratory (Colab) allows you to execute code on Google's cloud
servers, meaning you can leverage the power of Google hardware, including GPUs
and TPUs, regardless of the power of your machine. 

During this exercise we will get familiarised with the Colab platform. We will
also exercise our Python knowledge to perform a linear regression, a decision tree, 
and a gradient-boosted tree.

## Log Onto Google Colab
* Point your browser at the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  site.
* If you are not signed in, use the _Sign In_ button on the top right of
  the screen. 
* You will be presented with a popup box that allows importing a file or
  starting a new file. Hit the _Cancel_ button and take some time to read
  the _"What is Colaboratory?"_ document located [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=5fCEDCU_qrC0). 
* Once you have a general understanding of what Colab is, proceed to the
  next section.

## Upload Base Notebook Built during the class
* Upload a file from the _File_ menu using the _Upload Notebook_ option. 
* You will see a popup that looks like this:
<img src="https://github.com/CODATA-RDA-DataScienceSchools/Materials/blob/master/docs/SouthAfrica2021/Colab_Open.png" width="800"/>

* Click the _GitHub_ link on the top bar menu.
* Enter this link:
  `https://github.com/CODATA-RDA-DataScienceSchools/Materials/blob/master/docs/DataTrieste2024/CI/Colab_Regression_Spark.ipynb`
  into the search field.
* This will open the Google Colaboratory Demo Notebook we will
  be looking at during this lesson.
* Don't forget to reconnect the kernel by using the "Connect" button at the
  top right of the notebook as can be seen at the image:
